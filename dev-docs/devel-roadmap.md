### [Documentation Revision](documentation-revision.md)

The sphinx/breathe documentation is outdated and needs to be updated for the
`cmakemigration` branch. The goals are:

- Improve the readme and program summary for the landing page and Github
- Update the user guide to provide a walkthrough of major program features and use-cases
- Maintain a hardware catalog of C++ drivers/capabilities
- Create a developer's guide to explain the overall code structure, conventions, major
data classes, and guides for adding new hardware and implementations
- Provide an API reference for the most important classes for developers. Specifically,
these should be classes like SettingsStorage, HardwareObject, etc that are used
throughout the code. These classes should have Doxygen-style annotations in headers for
autogeneration with breathe.

### [Packaging and Binary Generation (Github Actions)](packaging-and-ci.md)

Ensure that cmake packaging instructions (cmake/Packaging.cmake) are compatible with
Github Actions runners for binary compilation for Windows, MacOS, and Linux (rpm,
deb, and AppImage). Binaries should be generated only on demand, not on every push.
