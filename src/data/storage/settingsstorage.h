/*!
 * \brief The SettingsStorage class manages persistent settings (through QSettings)
 *
 * The SettingsStorage class proides a unified interface for classes that need to read from or write to
 * persistent storage through QSettings. For read-only access to QSettings, a SettingsStorage object can
 * be created at any point in the code and initialized with the appropriate keys that refer to the group
 * that needs to be read from. All functions that modify values in QSettings are protected. Classes that
 * wish to use SettingsStorage to write to persistent storage need to inherit SettingsStorage and initialize
 * it in their constructors. If any of the set/register functions are called, values will be written to storage
 * during the function call (if the optional write argument is true) or when the object is deleted.
 * To prevent automatic saving, see SettingsStorage::discardValues(). This will not affect previously-written values though!
 * Note that if any getters have been registered, the objects they refer to must still exist or the code
 * will crash! A common scenario is to register a getter on an object in the user interface. If the ui
 * pointer is deleted in the derived class's destructor, then any getter registered on a UI element will
 * crash! Call SettingsStorage::clearGetters() in the derived class destructor to avoid this.
 *
 * SettingsStorage does not inherit any other classes, and it is suitable for use
 * in multiple inheritance with QObject-derived classes. **However:** classes that inherit from SettingsStorage
 * will have their assignment and copy constructors deleted! Do not inherit from SettingsStorage in a
 * class that needs to be passed around by value (such as data storage classes like Experiment). This class
 * is intended for use with objects that only passed by pointer (e.g., HardwareObject, UI classes, etc).
 *
 * A SettingsStorage object reads and maintains an internal copy of the QSettings keys and values associated
 * with the group/subgroup that it is initialized with. Internally, this is done through the use of two
 * associative containers (key-value containers): one which represents single key-value pairs,
 * and another that contains array values as structured by QSettings. An array value is a list whose items
 * each contain a map consisting of one or more key-value pairs.
 *
 * When initializing SettingsStorage, the standard constructor is
 *
 *     SettingsStorage::SettingsStorage(const QStringList keys, Type type)
 *
 * QSettings::beginGroup will be called for each key in the keys list. If the list is empty, then
 * the group is set to "Blackchirp". If Type is set to Hardware and the length of the keys list is 1,
 * then the program assumes the key in the list corresponds to a HardwareObject, and the current subKey
 * will be added to the keys list upon opening QSettings. An alternative form of the constructor exists that
 * take QString specifically for single-key operations, and will append an index if the type is Hardware:
 *
 *     SettingsStorage::SettingsStorage(const QString key, Type type = General, int index=0)
 *
 *
 * To create a read-only SettingsStorage object that reads the global Blackchirp settings:
 *
 *     SettingsStorage s;
 *
 * If instead you need read-only access to the "AWG-0/virtual" group:
 *
 *     SettingsStorage s({"AWG-0","virtual"});
 *
 * In general, it is recommended that you use keys that are statically defined in header files for accessing items.
 * For read-only access to the settings associated with the current AWG implementation:
 *
 *     SettingsStorage s(BC::Key::AWG::key,SettingsStorage::Hardware);
 *
 * For hardware types with multiple items (e.g., Clocks, PulseGenerators, etc), pass the index as the third argument.
 * For instance, to access the second (index=1) pulse generator:
 *
 *     SettingsStorage s(BC::Key::PGen::key,SettingsStorage::Hardware,1);
 *
 *
 * The value associated with a key can be obtained with one of the SettingsStorage::get functions. If there
 * is an integer associacted with the key "myInt", it can be accessed as:
 *
 *     //returns a QVariant containing "myInt", or QVariant() if "myKey" is not found.
 *     QVariant v = get("myInt");
 *
 *     //attempts to convert to an integer using QVariant::value.
 *     //Returns default-constructed value if unsuccessful
 *     int v2 = get<int>("myInt");
 *
 *     //in either case. a default argument can be supplied, which will be returned if the key
 *     //is not found.
 *     QVariant defaultInt = get("myInt",10);
 *     int defaultInt2 = get<int>("myInt",10);
 *
 *
 * There is also SettingsStorage::getMultiple that returns a std::map<QString,Qvariant> containing
 * all keys that match the indicated values.
 *
 * Array values can be accessed with the SettingsStorage::getArray function, which returns a const reference
 * to the array as a std::vector<SettingsMap>. The vector will be empty if the key is not found.
 * Alternatively, a reference to a particular SettingsMap within the array can be accesed by index with
 * SettingsStorage::getArrayMap. The returned map will be empty if the index is out of bounds or if the key
 * is not found. Finally, SettingsStorage::getArrayValue may be used to access one individual element in an
 * array value map by its key, using an interface similar to SettingsStorage::get.
 *
 *     //Access "arrayKey" map at index 1, return value associated with "mapKey"
 *     //If "arrayKey" is not present, 1 is out of bounds, or "mapKey" is not present, v contains defaultValue
 *     QVariant v = getArrayValue("arrayKey",1,"mapKey",defaultValue);
 *
 *     //alternative form using template function; d will contain 1.5 if lookup fails.
 *     double d = getArrayValue("arrayKey",1,"mapKey",1.5)
 *
 * The SettingsStorage::containsValue and SettingsStorage::containsArray functions can be used to check whether
 * a given key exists for a standard value or an array value, respectively.
 *
 * To obtain write access to persistent storage thogh the SettingsStorage interface, an object must inherit
 * from SettingsStorage: e.g., `class MyClass : public QObject, public SettingsStorage`, and the constructor
 * must initialise SettingsStorage with an initializer; e.g.,
 *
 *     MyClass::MyClass(QObject *parent) : QObject(parent),
 *         SettingsStorage({"MyClassKey","MyClassSubkey"})
 *     {
 *         //other initialization
 *     }
 *
 * Again, it is preferred to define static keys in the header file of your class instead of manually writing them.
 * When working with a subclass of SettingsStorage, the object has access to the SettingsStorage::set,
 * SettingsStorage::setMultiple, and SettingsStorage::setArray functions. Each of these takes an optional
 * bool argument (default false) that controls whther the new value is immedately written to settings.
 * If false, the value is just stored in memory until a call to SettingsStorage::save() is made. If the
 * key in a call to one of the set functions does not exist, a new key-value pair is added.
 *
 * In addition, a subclass may call SettingsStorage::readAll at any point to reread all values from settings.
 * However, any keys associated with a getter will not be read! If this behavior is undesired, first unregister
 * any getters before calling readAll, ensuring that the optional write parameter is set to false.
 *
 * Subclasses may also use the SettingsStorage::setDefault or SettingsStorage::getOrSetDefault functions
 * to add a new key to the settings. In either case, if the key already exists, the value remains unmodified.
 * If it does not exist, a new entry in the QSettings file is immediately created with the provided default value.
 * The getOrSetDefault function will return the value in the settings, while the setDefault function can be used
 * if the value is not needed immediately. For example:
 *
 *
 *     QVariant out = getOrSetDefault("existingKey",10);
 *     //out contains value of "existingKey", which may not be 10
 *
 *     QVariant out2 = getOrSetDefault("newKey",10);
 *     //out contains 10; "newKey" added to QSettings
 *
 *     setDefault("newKey2",20);
 *     //get<int>("newKey2") returns 20
 *
 *     setDefault("newKey",20);
 *     //get<int>("newKey") returns 10, as this key was already added above.
 *
 *
 * Finally, subclasses may call SettingsStorage::registerGetter to associate a function with a key. Any
 * subsequent references to that key will call the associated function to retrieve the value. A call to
 * SettingsStorage::save() will retrieve the value from the stored function to save. In this way, the subclass
 * does not have to call SettingsStorage::set every time a value changes. This mechanism only works for
 * single key-value settings, not for array values. Getters may be cleared individually with
 * SettingsStorage::unRegisterGetter or all at once with SettingsStorage::clearGetters. When unregistered
 * or cleared, the getter function is called and the value stored in memory for later use/saving. Optionally,
 * the value can be immediately written to QSettings.
 *
 * A getter function must be a const member function that takes no arguments and returns a type known to QVariant.
 * New types can be made known to QVariant using the Q_DECLARE_METATYPE macro; see the QVariant documentation
 * for details. An example:
 *
 *
 *     class MyClass : public SettingsStorage()
 *     {
 *     public:
 *         MyClass();
 *
 *         int getInt() const { return d_int; }
 *
 *     private:
 *         int d_int = 1;
 *     };
 *
 *     MyClass::MyClass() : SettingsStorage({},false)
 *     {
 *         registerGetter("myInt",this,&MyClass::getInt);
 *         int i = get<int>("myInt");
 *         // i == 1
 *
 *         d_int = 10;
 *         int j = get<int>("myInt");
 *         // j == 10
 *
 *         QVariant k = unRegisterGetter("myInt",false);
 *         //k == 10; do not write 10 to QSettings
 *
 *         d_int = 20;
 *         int l = get<int>("myInt");
 *         //l == 10
 *     }
 *
