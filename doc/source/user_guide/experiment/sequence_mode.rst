Sequence mode allows for a series of identical experiments to be automatically repeated at a designated time interval. The template for the experiment can be initiated from a `Quick Experiment <quick_experiment.html>`_ or manually configured like normal. Between experiments in a sequence mode acquisition, the user interface will display a message stating when the next acquisition will begin. The sequence may be cancelled at any time by pressing the Abort button on the main user interface.
