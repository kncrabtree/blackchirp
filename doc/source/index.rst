Blackchirp Documentation
========================

Blackchirp is a cross-platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) data acquisition program for chirped-pulse Fourier transform microwave spectrometers.
It accomodates a variety of hardware combinations (digitizers, waveform generators, delay generators, flow controllers, etc) and supports multiple acquisition modes, including segmented acquisitions and double resonance experiments.
Data acquired by Blackchirp can be viewed and interacted with in real time during an ongoing acquisition, and is written to disk in a plain-text CSV-like format for easy processing with Python scripts or other analysis packages.
